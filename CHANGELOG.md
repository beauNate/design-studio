## [2.1.1] — 2026-03-10

Bug fixes, documentation, and quality improvements based on public review feedback.

### Fixed

- **FID → INP**: Replaced deprecated First Input Delay with Interaction to Next Paint in deployment.md (thresholds updated to <200ms / >500ms)
- **Accordion anti-pattern**: Replaced `max-height: 500px` hack with modern `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` pattern in motion-designer.md
- **Type scale mislabel**: Corrected "1.25 ratio" to "Tailwind defaults" in ui-designer.md and brand-kit.md, added clarifying note
- **SOURCE_WIDTH undeclared**: Added variable declaration in ab-variants.md figma_execute block
- **Hardcoded project names**: Replaced 'Feed'/'Saved'/'Discover' with generic nav-hiding heuristic in figma-responsive.md
- **Eval #4 broken path**: Fixed fixture reference to `./evals/fixtures/test-page.html` and created the fixture file
- **Eval #11 missing assertion**: Added `has-speaker-notes` assertion to design-presentation eval
- **Installation command**: Replaced non-existent `claude plugin add` with `git clone` in README

### Added

- **MCP-SETUP.md**: Complete guide for 4 optional MCP servers — Figma REST, Desktop Bridge, Claude Preview, Playwright — with install instructions, verification steps, and "Working Without MCP" table
- **MCP Fallback sections**: All 16 commands now have documented fallback behavior when MCP servers are unavailable

- **Eval validator script**: `scripts/run-evals.sh` validates JSON structure, counts assertions, checks fixture references

### Changed

- Stop hook expanded to all 16 commands (grouped: Core, Figma)
- README requirements section now links to MCP-SETUP.md
